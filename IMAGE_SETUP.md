# Professional Headshot Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Save Your Professional Headshot

1. **Right-click** on the professional headshot image you uploaded
2. **Select "Save image as..."**
3. **Navigate** to your portfolio folder: `C:\Users\comat\GitProjects\vibecoding-intro-comaverick18\`
4. **Name the file**: `charlie-headshot.jpg`
5. **Click "Save"**

## Step 2: Image Positioning

I've already optimized the CSS to center the image on your face using:
- `object-position: center 20%` - This positions the crop to focus on your face area
- The circular crop will show your face prominently while maintaining the professional look

## Step 3: Test the Website

After saving the image:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Your professional headshot should now appear in the About section
3. The image will be perfectly circular and centered on your face

## Alternative: If You Want to Use a Different Image

If you want to use a different professional photo later:

1. Save the new image as `charlie-headshot.jpg` (replacing the old one)
2. Or save it with a different name and update the `content.js` file:
   ```javascript
   profileImage: "your-new-image-name.jpg"
   ```

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Any size (the CSS will automatically resize it to 300x300px)
- **Quality**: High resolution recommended for crisp display
- **Aspect Ratio**: Any aspect ratio works (circular crop will be applied)

## Current Setup

Your website is now configured to use:
- **Image file**: `charlie-headshot.jpg`
- **Alt text**: Professional description for accessibility
- **Positioning**: Centered on face area
- **Style**: Circular crop with dark theme border

Once you save the image file, your professional portfolio will be complete with your actual headshot!
